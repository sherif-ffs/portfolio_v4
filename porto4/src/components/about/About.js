                <p>My name is Sherif, I'm a designer/developer, and current junior at the New Jersey Institute of 
                    Technology where I study Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Web and Mobile Development.</p>
                <p>Long story short, I've been in front of a computer, for better or for worse,
                     for the better part of the last decade. My interest in technology evolved into a passion for web design. When I 
                     was introduced to CSS and JavaScript and the creative possibilities it possessed, there was basically no turning back. 
                     A love affair with UI/UX design was soon to follow. Since that time, whether working on school projects, interning in 
                     New York City, or working independently, I've tried to push the envelope, make my mark, and fulfill my creative potential.
